main.cpp is the main code file.
You have to run main.cpp to look at my library management system program.
Hint: For linux users, you can use command - "g++ main.cpp" and then "./a.out" in the terminal opened in the folder containing this file.

When the code runs, it will ask for input at different stages of execution.
For example- When you just enter the program, it asks wheather you want to log in as student, professor or librarian or want to exit the system.

At first there is no user except the librarian, so you have to login as librarian.
Enter 3. 
Then enter username as "IndranilSir" and password as "IsGreat".

Then you would have variety of options as librarian like view all books, add or update both books and users.
Only the librarian has admin power and can add, update and delete users and books.

Just for test run,
Add some books by doing as instructed.
e.g. Book1: Title - Harry Potter
			Author - J.K Rowling
			ISBN - 9780747532743 
			Publication - Bloomsbury Publishing

	 Book2:	Title - Book2
			Author - TheAuthor
			ISBN - 9780747532881
			Publication - AnyPublication


Add some users of both type, students and professors.
e.r. Student:   Name- Akshunya
				User id - akshunyav
				password - password


Now you can use other functionalities like update, delete, list, search and much more.
Now log out and log into some account you made before.
Now you can use functionalities of students and professors like- issue,list issued books, search, calculate fine, etc.

Note-   Don't forget to exit the program when you quit.
		Don't quit the program in between running of code.
